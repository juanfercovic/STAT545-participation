# STAT545-participation



## Who am I?
My name is Juan Fercovic and I am from Chile. Now after 6 years in Canada, I have a Masterâ€™s degree and I am in the second year of my PhD in Environmental Economics (I did more stuff in between :wink:). One of our class mates in my Thesis supervisor :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

In general, my life can be placed in the following dimensions:

|*My wife and daughter* | *Climbing* | *Study* |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| My daughter is 2 | I live in Squamish (the mecca here) and commute to campus | My research in on energy consumption and emissions |
